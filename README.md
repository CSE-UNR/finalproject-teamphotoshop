# Final Group Project

## Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **coding collaboratively**
2.	Familiarize students with **2D Arrays**
3.	Provide students with continued practice using **everything!**
   
## Important Notes
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For your testing purposes, the autograder will be compiling your code.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files, points will be deducted if no header comments are included.

## Submission
If you are using git from the command line, you can follow these steps:
1.	Copy the clone URL from the green button above.
2.	Type `git clone <your URL>` into the terminal window.
3.	`cd` into your new assignment directory.
4.	Save your `images.c` file to this directory and write your program.
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.

# Program
Erinstagram!

## Background
This project is loosely based on concepts associated with image processing https://www.simplilearn.com/image-processing-article

Our image "size" will be the number of "pixels" and we'll be approximating "grayscale" images. The files will store numerical values which represent how "bright" that "pixel" is. The characters used to "render" or display the image will correspond to the brightness level (see the table below).

![pixel_values](https://github.com/CSE-UNR/cs135-pa9/assets/2504089/3d4bc578-3b35-437f-80f4-e4ffcf3dee21)

## Behavior
The user should be able to choose from a menu which must include the following options.
- load a new image
- display the current image
- edit the current image
- exit the program  

If the user chooses to load an new image, the program should attempt to read the contents of an image of any "size" from a file name they provide.  

The display option should be able to display the correct characters for an image of any "size".

If the user chooses to edit the current image, they should be able to choose from another menu which must include the following options. The new version of the image should be displayed each time.
- crop
- dim
- brighten

The crop option provides the user with a way to specify which smaller section of the original image they would like to use to create an edited image.  

The dim option creates an edited image where each pixel is one step "dimmer".  

The brighten option creates an edited image where each pixel is one step "brighter".

After completing one of the above editing options, the user should be prompted to save their edited image to a file. If they agree, they should be prompted for a file name. Once the edited image is saved, they should be returned to the original menu.

The user can end the program from the original menu by choosing the exit option.

### Extra Credit
Add another option to the edit menu for rotating an image 90 degrees which creates an edited image where every pixel in the image has been moved to a new location to create the "rotation" effect. *Extra Credit tasks will not be considered for grading unless all other requirements have been met.*

## Hints
- You can start testing your program on the file included in this repository, but your program should work on any file which follows the format described in the Backround section.
   - This includes image files generated by the program itself.
- I used files with a `.txt` extension to make it easy to open them with an editor.
- **There is no endline on the last line of the file provided!**

## Requirements
- **You may *NOT* use any libraries other than `stdio` and `stdbool`.**
- There must be ***at least*** 6 functions, in addition to the main (my program had 8)
- There must be ***at least*** one function which uses *explicit* **pass by address** (arrays are *implicitly* passed by address)
- *Extra Credit tasks will not be considered for grading unless all other requirements have been met.*

## Example Program Execution
An example executable is provided in this repository.
- You should be able to run it from your project folder in a Linux environment. 
- If you encounter a “permission denied” error when attempting to run the executable, type  
```chmod u+x imagesExecutable```  
into the terminal and try running the executable again.
